# üåä Corelink Submarine Tracking System
Corelink is an advanced maritime platform built to monitor and manage submarine operations. Built on a React-based Turborepo monorepo architecture, Corelink dynamically loads microfrontends to provide real-time, modular updates from various submarine systems. The platform is highly flexible, allowing new components to be added easily through a dynamic federation setup.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To get started with Corelink, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the following command in the root directory:
```sh
npm install
```
3. Once dependencies are installed, launch the project with:
```sh
npm start
```
That's it! Everything else is already configured for you. The Corelink app and all its components will be up and running.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Project Structure
**Corelink** is a React-based monorepo using Turborepo to manage its three key applications:

- **Corelink (Kernel)**: the core app acts as the kernel, dynamically loading microfrontends via module federation. 

- **System Lens** (MFe): exposes information about the processes and status inside the submarines.

- **Control Flow** (MFe): focuses on operational flow and control of submarine systems.

## üì¶ Modular Design with Dynamic Microfrontends
Corelink's dynamic module federation simplifies system updates and expansion:

- **Dynamic Microfrontend Loading**: New microfrontends can be added by editing the `sidebar.json` file, allowing seamless integration of external apps without code changes.

- **Drag and Drop**: Panels from Control Flow or System Lens can be freely moved, resized, and positioned for a customizable workspace.

- **Resizing**: Users can adjust panel sizes to focus on specific data, enhancing control over submarine operations.

## üõ† Turborepo Setup
The Corelink platform uses **Turborepo** for managing the three applications in the monorepo:

- **Simplifies package management**: Only one npm install is needed from the root.
- **Speeds up development**: Built-in tools for running and building multiple projects simultaneously.
- **Consistency**: Shared dependencies and workspace scripts ensure all microfrontends work seamlessly together.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Future-Proof and Scalable
The flexibility of dynamically adding microfrontends ensures Corelink is future-proof. This approach allows for:

- **Scalability**: New microfrontends can be added without modifying the core codebase.
- **Ease of Maintenance**: Updates to individual microfrontends do not affect the overall platform stability.
- **Rapid Deployment**: Teams can focus on developing new features while Corelink automatically integrates them.
